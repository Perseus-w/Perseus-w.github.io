## The Idea

At the current time of writing this I will soon be entering my final semester at the University of Central Florida. During my time here, I have completed several projects that up until now have not had a place to be properly showcased. That is where this website comes in. My website serves not only as a way to document my learning journey and projects to potential employers, but also as a platform where I can continue to share my ideas with anyone who happens to stumble across it.

## The Implementation

I've always wanted to create a website for the longest time, but I either didn't have the time or didn't know the best way to do so. I finally sat down one day and brainstormed how to make it happen. I threw around the possibilities of using one of those website creating websites or also thought about just coding the entire website from scratch. After some further research, I finally settled on using a modified Jekyll template, hosted through GitHub Pages, and paired with a custom domain name. With this setup I have a website with a secure TLS connection, no home network being put at risk, and I can share all the information I would like over my own personal domain.

## The Journey Ahead

Looking ahead, I plan to update this site regularly with any future projects or homelab upgrades I am currently working on. My goal is to use this website to document my journey and share my ideas and experiences that might be helpful to others. I look forward to sharing what's next!
